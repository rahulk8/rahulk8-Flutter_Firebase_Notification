This app would not have been possible without help from this tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHUMWfBxRk

This a flutter Notification app made using flutter_core and flutter_messaging dependency from pub.dev.
App has following functionality:
1.     Foreground notification with dialog
2.     Notification in Background (app opened from notification tap)
3.     Notification in Terminated state  i.e. app is fully closed (not running in background), and we  still receive/show notifications
